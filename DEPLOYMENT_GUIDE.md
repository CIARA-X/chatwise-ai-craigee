npm install -g @railway/cli

# Login
railway login

# Navigate to backend directory
cd backend

# Create new project
railway new

# Deploy
railway up
```

**Option B: Using Railway Web Interface**
1. Go to [Railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Click "New Project"
3. Choose "Deploy from GitHub repo" or "Empty Project"
